Blade is played one-on-one with a single Blade deck consisting of Blade cards numbered from 1 to 7, Bolt cards, and Mirror cards. 

Board
The parts of the board are as follows.

Decks: One for each player. This consists of five cards per player, not visible to either player. The players play from here only when the field is clear.

Hands: One for each player. This is not visible to the other player during play. Each player draws ten to their hand at the start of the game and plays all "attacks" from here.

Field: Each player has a pile of face-up cards they add to with each play. All cards are cleared from the field after a play when both current totals are the same.

Gameplay
To play, 30 cards are taken from the deck and divided in half (15cards) for each player. Each player draws ten cards into their hand, hidden from their opponent.

The first move is called "dicking", where each player draws a card from their deck and plays it on the field as a face-off to start each of their piles.
The number of the card is added to each player's current total in play. Cards that don't have numbers always have the value of "1" in a "dick".

Play always goes to the player with the lower current total. The goal is to have a greater current total than the opponent. 
The player plays an "attack" from their hand to this goal.

If their total is now higher than their opponent's total, the opponent must then play an "attack".

If their total is now equal to their opponent's total, the field is cleared of cards (and totals) and both players must "dick" again from their deck.
If the decks are empty, they may choose from their hand. The game is a draw if there are no cards to choose from at this point.

If either player's hand becomes empty on their turn or either player plays a card that raises their total to a value less than their opponent's total,
the game ends and the player with the higher current total wins.

The game ends with a loss for a player if the last card they can play is a Bolt or Mirror; This is called a "foul".
